# Data set introduction

Meat is an important source of nutrition for many people around the world. Meat production and consumption greatly affect the sustainable development of the world.

With the continuous development of the global economy and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the market has numerous demands for meat products, with more and more variety requirements and higher quality requirements. So that we could better understand the situation about the global meat production.

The data set was obtained from the "Our World in Data" data base and contains the following variables regarding to meat production of the world:
 
* Country
* Year
* Amount of production: Measure in tons.
* Livestock types: including beef and buffalo, pigmeat, poultry, sheep and goat,  and other meat types such as horse or camel et cetera.
* Meat type consumption (kg/capita/year).


# Research questions
- How did global meat production develop by continents?
- How did the meat production develop in some countries which contributed greatly?
- What's the production distribution of different livestock types across the world?
- Which countries are main production country for different types of meat, such as: Beef and buffalo, pig and poultry? 
- Which countries eat the most meat in the last 20 years?
- What types of meat do people eat?

**Q1: How did global meat production develop by continents?**

```{r tidy-data, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

df <- global_production %>%
  group_by(Entity) %>%

```

        legend.text = element_text(size = 12))
```  

From Figure\@ref(fig:continent-figure), we can see all continents show an uptrend. In particular, production in Asia has increased from around 10 million tonnes to around 150 million tonnes. And in 1992, Asia produced more than Europe and became the largest meat producer.

See Figure\@ref(fig:continent-increase). In 2018, meat production in Asia has increased around 15 times, accounting for around 43% of total production, while the proportion of Europe and Northern America has decreased, although their production has increased.

See Figure\@ref(fig:country-increase). In 2018, The world's meat production has increased around quadrupled. And China has increased about 34 times compared to 1961, accounting for about 26% of global meat production. And the meat production in United States accounted for about 14%, although the production only has doubled.

In figure \@ref(fig:productiontype), we see that the dominant livestock types are poultry, cattle (which includes beef and buffalo meat), pig, and sheep & goat to a lesser extent at global level.

Although production of all major meat types have been increasing in absolute terms, in relative terms the share of global meat types have changed significantly over the last 50 years. In 1961, poultry meat accounted for small portion; by 2013 its share has tripled. In comparison, beef and buffalo meat as a share of total meat production has nearly halved. And the Pig meat’s share has remained more constant.

\subsection*{Analysis}

**Q1: Which countries eat the most meat in the last 20 years? **

As can be seen from the Table \@ref(tab:highest-meanconsumption) below, the top six countries with the highest average meat consumption mean in the world over the 20-year period from 1997 to 2017 are the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Spain, French Polynesia and Bahamas. The highest per capita meat consumption mean of the United States reached about 121.2 kg/capita/year. It can be concluded that countries with high income also consume more meat. Developed countries account for a large share of the six countries with the highest average meat consumption over years. 

```{r highest-meanconsumption, echo = FALSE}

                                   "Spain", 
                                   "French Polynesia", 
                                   "Bahamas",
                                   "World")) 

ggplot(highest_consumption_trend, 
      aes(x = Year, 
          y = Total_consumption_kg_capita_yr, 
          color = Country)) + 
 geom_line()  

#ggplotly()
```

```{r Bahamas-trend, echo = FALSE}
Bahamas <- highest_consumption_trend %>% filter(Country == "Bahamas") 
Decline <- Bahamas %>% mutate(Decline_Percentage = (Bahamas$Total_consumption_kg_capita_yr[1]-Bahamas$Total_consumption_kg_capita_yr[21])/Bahamas$Total_consumption_kg_capita_yr[1] * 100)

```

In terms of changing trends, figure \@ref(fig:highest-consumption-trend) shows the meat consumption per person in these countries over the last 20 years have fluctuated considerably, with the exception of Australia and the United States, where consumption has increased, while all other countries have shown a decreasing trend, especially Bahamas, with around `r round(Decline$Decline_Percentage[1])`% decline. However, the total value is still much higher than the world per capita meat consumption. New Zealand has the largest meat-eaters, consuming around 126 kilograms per person in 2011.

**Q2: What types of meat do people eat?**


```{r Meat-type, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Meat type changes over time"}
Meat_type <- meat_consumption %>% filter(Country == "World") %>%
  pivot_longer(col = Mutton_Goat:Beef_Bufallo,
               names_to = "Type",
               values_to = "Per_capita_meat_consumption_by_type")

ggplot(Meat_type, 
      aes(x = Year, 
          y = Per_capita_meat_consumption_by_type,
          fill = Type)) + 
 scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(min(Meat_type$Year),
                 max(Meat_type$Year), by=4))+
 geom_col() 

#ggplotly()
```

I visualized five types of meat consumption of world that collected from 1961 to 2013, which are Beef & Bufallo meat, Mutton & Goat meat, pork, poultry and other types meat. From figure \@ref(fig:Meat-type), it illustrates that as a global average, pork has the highest per capita consumption of meat commodities; in 2013, see table \@ref(tab:consump-detail) below, per capita pork consumption was about 16 kg; followed by 15 kg of poultry; 9 kg of beef & buffalo meat; 2 kg of lamb & goat; and only a small percentage of other meats, such as horse or camel.


```{r consump-detail, echo = FALSE}
consump_detail <- Meat_type %>% filter(Year == 2013) %>% 
   select(-Code,-Total_consumption_kg_capita_yr) %>%
  arrange(desc(Per_capita_meat_consumption_by_type))

knitr::kable(consump_detail, 
             caption = "The consumption of different types of meat in 2013", 
             digits = 2) 

```

# Conclusion
- In 2018, production was around **340** million tonnes. **Asia and China** have contributed greatly to global meat production.

- The amount of meat produced for a given animal **varies significantly** across the world based on production systems.

- **Richer countries** tend to consume more meat per person. **Developed countries** account for a **large share** of the six countries with the highest average meat consumption in the last 20 years. 

- The average person in the world consumed around **43 kilograms of meat in 2014**. This ranges from over **100kg in the US and Australia** to only **5kg in India**.

- Although there is a lot of **fluctuation**, the amount of meat consumed per capita is **much larger** than the world average.

- At the world level, per capita consumption of **pork is the highest** among meat commodities over years.
