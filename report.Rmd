\section*{Brief about Meat Production}

- What's the status of meat production across the world?

- How did the CO2 emissions per capita of the two countries develop  from 1960 to 2020?

\subsection*{Research Question}

```{r load-data, echo = FALSE , message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
GD <- read_csv(file = "Data/global-meat-production.csv")
MT <- read_csv(file = "Data/global-meat-production-by-livestock-type.csv")
```

## Q1
```{r production, echo = FALSE , message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
production <- GD %>%
  select(-Code) %>% 
  filter(Entity %in% c("Asia",
                       "Europe",
                       "Northern America",
                       "South America",
                       "Central America",
                       "Africa",
                       "Oceania")) %>%
    rename("Production"= "Livestock Primary - Meat, Total - 1765 - Production - 5510 - tonnes") %>%
    group_by(Entity, Year)

plt_pd<- ggplot(production, aes(x= Year,
                                y= Production, 
                                fill= Entity)) + 
    geom_area(alpha=0.6 , size=.5, colour="white")+
    scale_fill_viridis(discrete = T) +
    theme_minimal()+
    ggtitle("Global meat production, 1961 to 2018")+
    scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format(big.mark = "."))

ggplotly(plt_pd)
```

Regionally, **Asia is the largest meat producer**, accounting for near 50  percent of total meat production. This regional distribution has changed significantly in recent decades. In 1961, Europe and North America were the dominant meat producers, however Asia only produced little portion. By 2013, Europe and North Americaâ€™s share had fallen noticeably.

```{r fig2, echo = FALSE , message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Comparison of the urbanization development"}
ET2 <- raw %>%
          dplyr::filter(Country_Name %in% c("Ethiopia",
                                            "Italy")) %>%
                 rename(Country = Country_Name) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = Year,
           y = Urban_population,
           fill = Country) ) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge()) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(direction = 1) +
  theme_bw()

ET3 <- raw %>%
          dplyr::filter(IncomeGroup %in% c("Low income",
                                           "High income")) %>%
                 
ggplot(aes(x = Year,
           y = Urban_population,
           fill = IncomeGroup) ) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge()) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(direction = -1) +
  theme_bw()

grid.arrange(ET2, ET3, nrow = 2)
```


In figure \@ref(fig:fig2) we observe the level of urbanization in Ethiopia is still strong, but on the other hand, Italy is quite stable. And we observe the similar trend in the plot of income group.

Based on this finding, we may conclude that the level of urbanization of the country may be significantly affected by its development of economic and its state income.
