# Data set introduction

Feeding the world in a sustainable way is one of our most pressing challenges in the coming decades. Meat plays a pivotal role in this.

Meat is an important source of nutrition for many people around the world. Global demand for meat is growing: over the past 50 years, meat production has more than tripled. The world now produces more than 340 million tonnes each year.

But the production of meat has large environmental impacts – increasing greenhouse gas emissions, agricultural land and freshwater use. One of the world’s most pressing challenges is to produce and consume meat, dairy and other protein products in a way that reduces its environmental impacts.

The data set was obtained from the "Our World in Data" data base and contains the following variables regarding to meat production of the world:
 
* Country
* Year
* Amount of production: Measure in tons.
* Livestock types: including beef and buffalo, pigmeat, poultry, sheep and goat,  and other meat types such as horse or camel et cetera.
* Meat type consumption (kg/capita/year).

```

\subsection*{Analysis} 

**Q1: How does global meat production develop from 1961 to 2018?**

```{r tidy-data, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

global_production <- global_production %>%
  rename("meat_production" = "Livestock.Primary...Meat..Total...1765...Production...5510...tonnes") %>%
  mutate(meat_production = round(meat_production/1000000, digits = 2)) %>%
  filter(Entity %in% c("Oceania", "Africa", "Central America", "South America", "Northern America", "Europe", "Asia")) 


df <- global_production %>%
  group_by(Entity) %>%
  mutate(meat_sum = sum(meat_production)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(meat_sum) 

df <- df %>%
  mutate(Entity = factor(Entity, unique(Entity))) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  mutate(total = sum(meat_production))

 
```

```{r continent-figure, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap="Global meat production from 1961 to 2018"}
ggplot(df, aes(x = Year, y = meat_production, color = Entity))+
  geom_line()+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1961,1970,1980, 1990, 2000, 2010,2018))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 10, 50, 100, 150))+
  ylab("livestock meat production (million tonnes)")+
  theme_bw()
```  

From Figure\@ref(fig:continent-figure), we can see all continents show an uptrend. In 2018, production was around 340 million tonnes.
In particular, Asia production increased from under 10 million tonnes to around 150 million tonnes, and produced more meat than Europe in 1992, and become the largest meat production continent. And Europe shows a fluctuating growth, while another continents show steady growth.

**Q2:  How do the Top six countries of meat production develop from 1961 to 2018?**

```{r tidy-data2, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

production <- production %>%
   rename("meat_production" = "Livestock.Primary...Meat..Total...1765...Production...5510...tonnes") %>%
  mutate(meat_production = round(meat_production/1000000, digits = 2)) 

df2 <- production %>%
  group_by(Entity) %>%
  mutate(meat_sum = sum(meat_production)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(-meat_sum) 

df2 <- df2 %>%
  filter(Code != "" &
        Code %in% c("CHN", "USA", "BRA", "DEU", "FRA", "ARG"))
 

```


```{r country, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap="Top six countries' meat production from 1961 to 2018"}

ggplot(df2, aes(x = Year, y = meat_production, color = Entity))+
  geom_line()+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1961,1970,1980, 1990, 2000, 2010,2018))+
  ylab("Top 6 countries of livestock meat production (million tonnes)")+
  theme_bw()

  
```

From Figure\@ref(fig:country), it is obvious that China meat production has increased sharply. And China surpassed the United States in 1990 and became the largest meat production country in the world at the same time.

In figure \@ref(fig:productiontype), we see that the dominant livestock types are poultry, cattle (which includes beef and buffalo meat), pig, and sheep & goat to a lesser extent at global level.

Although production of all major meat types have been increasing in absolute terms, in relative terms the share of global meat types have changed significantly over the last 50 years. In 1961, poultry meat accounted for small portion; by 2013 its share has tripled. In comparison, beef and buffalo meat as a share of total meat production has nearly halved. And the Pigmeat’s share has remained more constant.

In the table \@ref(tab:cattle), we see the global production of cattle (beef and buffalo) meat. From the country's perspective, The United States is the world’s largest beef and buffalo meat producer. Other major producers are Brazil and China.

In the table \@ref(tab:poultry), we can see the production of poultry, like cattle production, the United States is still the world’s largest producer. China and Brazil are also large poultry producers. Collectively, Europe is also a major poultry producer, just below the United States.

But for pigmeat production \@ref(tab:pig), China dominates global output, producing just short of half of total pigmeat. The other major producers include the United States, Germany.

```

\subsection*{Analysis}

**Q1: Which countries eat the most meat in the last 20 years? **

As can be seen from the Table \@ref(tab:highest-meanconsumption) below, the top six countries with the highest average meat consumption mean in the world over the 20-year period from 1997 to 2017 are the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Spain, French Polynesia and Bahamas. The highest per capita meat consumption mean of the United States reached about 121.2 kg/capita/year. It can be concluded that countries with high income also consume more meat.

```{r highest-meanconsumption, echo = FALSE}

highest_meanconsumption <- meat_consumption %>% 
                 filter(Year >= 1997) %>%
                 group_by(Country) %>%
                 summarise(Mean_consumption_kg_capita_yr = mean(Total_consumption_kg_capita_yr)) %>%
                 arrange(desc(Mean_consumption_kg_capita_yr)) %>%
                 select(Country, Mean_consumption_kg_capita_yr)

table_data2 <- head(highest_meanconsumption, 6)

knitr::kable(table_data2,
             caption = "Top 6 countries with the largest mean of meat consumption over years", digits = 2) 
```
\clearpage

In terms of changing trends, figure \@ref(fig:highest-consumption-trend) shows the meat consumption per person in these countries over the last 20 years have fluctuated considerably, with the exception of Australia and the United States, where consumption has increased, while all other countries have shown a decreasing trend, but the total value is still much higher than the world per capita meat consumption.

```{r highest-consumption-trend, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Consumption trend of top 6 countries"}
highest_consumption_trend <- meat_consumption %>% 
             filter(Year >= 1997) %>%
             filter(Country %in% c("United States", 
                                   "Australia", 
                                   "New Zealand", 
                                   "Spain", 
                                   "French Polynesia", 
                                   "Bahamas",
                                   "World")) 

ggplot(highest_consumption_trend, 
      aes(x = Year, 
          y = Total_consumption_kg_capita_yr, 
          color = Country)) + #color = Country
 geom_line()  #+ scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")

```

**Q2: What types of meat do people eat?**

From figure \@ref(fig:Meat-type), it illustrates that as a global average, pork has the highest per capita consumption of meat commodities; in 2013, per capita pork consumption was about 16 kg; followed by 15 kg of poultry; 9 kg of beef/buffalo meat; 2 kg of lamb and goat; and only a small percentage of other meats.

```{r Meat-type, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Meat type changes over time"}
Meat_type <- meat_consumption %>% filter(Country == "World") %>%
  pivot_longer(col = Mutton_Goat:Beef_Bufallo,
               names_to = "Type",
               values_to = "Per_capita_meat_consumption_by_type")

ggplot(Meat_type, 
      aes(x = Year, 
          y = Per_capita_meat_consumption_by_type,
          fill = Type)) + 
 scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(min(Meat_type$Year),
